#+TITLE: Multilingual Dependency Parsing
* Introduction
This project is my implementation of an arc-eager transition-based dependency parser based on the Joakim Nivre's Malt Parser. The assignment and provided code comes from Professor Dragomir Radev's course Introduction to Natural Language Processing on Coursera.
* Parser Performance
** With ~badfeatures.model~
In the initial step of this project, I implemented the transition parser in ~transition.py~. This allowed the parser to move through the proper configurations necessary to parse data.

The model provided for this stage, ~badfeatures.model~, returned the following scores:
- UAS: 0.229635530771
- LAS: 0.125672176857

As indicated by the name, the ~badfeatures~ model was intended as a baseline to demonstrate an inferior feature extractor.
